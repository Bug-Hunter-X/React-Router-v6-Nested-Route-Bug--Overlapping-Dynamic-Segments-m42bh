The solution involves restructuring the routes to avoid overlapping dynamic segments.  We can use wildcard paths (`*`) to indicate that a parent route should match any remaining path segments after matching its own dynamic segments. Then, child routes can use more specific patterns.

```javascript
<Route path='/users/:userId/*' element={<Users/>}>
  <Route path='profile' element={<UserProfile/>}/>
</Route>
```

In this corrected version, the parent route `/users/:userId/*` matches the `/users/123` part of the URL, passing the `userId` to the `Users` component.  The wildcard `*` consumes the rest of the path. The child route `/profile` then only matches `/profile` specifically, eliminating the conflict with parent path and ensures only the intended component renders correctly.  This approach prioritizes the child route with the more specific path while still ensuring that the parent component is aware of the parent path segment.
